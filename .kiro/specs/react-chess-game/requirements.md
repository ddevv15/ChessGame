# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a full-featured React.js chess game application with a sleek, modern, and minimal design. The application will support two-player local gameplay with proper chess rules, move validation, and an intuitive user interface. The game will be built using functional components and React hooks with a modular architecture that allows for easy scaling and future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see a properly rendered 8x8 chess board with pieces in their standard starting positions, so that I can begin playing a game of chess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display an 8x8 chess board with alternating light and dark squares
2. WHEN the board is rendered THEN the system SHALL place all chess pieces in their standard starting positions (white on bottom, black on top)
3. WHEN the board is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Unicode characters or SVGs for chess piece representation
4. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the board SHALL be responsive and maintain proper proportions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to move pieces by clicking and selecting them, so that I can play the game intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a piece THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected piece and show possible moves
2. WHEN I click on a valid destination square THEN the system SHALL move the piece to that location
3. WHEN I click on an invalid destination THEN the system SHALL not move the piece and provide visual feedback
4. WHEN a piece moves THEN the system SHALL display a smooth animation for the movement
5. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the system SHALL only allow that player to move their pieces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the game to enforce chess rules and validate moves, so that I can play a proper game of chess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to move a piece THEN the system SHALL validate the move according to chess rules for that piece type
2. WHEN a move would put my own king in check THEN the system SHALL prevent the move
3. WHEN a move captures an opponent's piece THEN the system SHALL remove the captured piece from the board
4. WHEN a pawn reaches the opposite end THEN the system SHALL promote it to a queen
5. WHEN a king is in check THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to see a history of moves made during the game, so that I can review the game progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a move is made THEN the system SHALL record it in algebraic notation in the move history
2. WHEN viewing the move history THEN the system SHALL display moves in chronological order
3. WHEN the move history panel is displayed THEN the system SHALL show it alongside the board in a minimal design
4. WHEN there are many moves THEN the system SHALL allow scrolling through the move history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to reset the game at any time, so that I can start a new game without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the reset button THEN the system SHALL return all pieces to their starting positions
2. WHEN the game is reset THEN the system SHALL clear the move history
3. WHEN the game is reset THEN the system SHALL set the turn back to white
4. WHEN the reset button is displayed THEN the system SHALL style it minimally to match the overall design

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean, modern, and minimal design, so that I can focus on the game without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface with only the board, reset button, and move history panel
2. WHEN styling the interface THEN the system SHALL use a minimal color palette and typography
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use a clean, minimal font
4. WHEN the interface is rendered THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary visual clutter or decorative elements
5. WHEN using CSS THEN the system SHALL implement styles using styled-components or CSS modules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to choose between playing against another human or an AI opponent, so that I can enjoy different types of chess experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a game mode selection screen with PvP and AI options
2. WHEN I select PvP mode THEN the system SHALL allow two human players to take turns on the same device
3. WHEN I select AI mode THEN the system SHALL allow me to play against a computer opponent
4. WHEN playing against AI THEN the system SHALL make intelligent moves using Google Gemini AI
5. WHEN in AI mode THEN the system SHALL provide difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)
6. WHEN switching game modes THEN the system SHALL properly reset the game state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the AI opponent to make challenging and realistic moves, so that I can improve my chess skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI makes a move THEN the system SHALL send the current board position in FEN format to the AI system
2. WHEN AI is thinking THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator to show processing
3. WHEN AI responds THEN the system SHALL receive a move in SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation) format only
4. WHEN AI move is received THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the SAN move before execution
5. WHEN AI provides invalid move THEN the system SHALL request a new move or use fallback logic
6. WHEN API call fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide fallback options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be modular and well-structured, so that the application can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use functional components with React hooks
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct, reusable components
3. WHEN structuring files THEN the system SHALL organize components, utilities, and styles in logical directories
4. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices for state management and component composition
5. WHEN creating the architecture THEN the system SHALL design it to be easily scalable for future features

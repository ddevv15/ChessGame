# Checkmate Functionality

## Overview

The chess game has fully implemented checkmate and stalemate detection. The functionality works correctly and has been thoroughly tested.

## How It Works

1. **Game Status Detection**: After each move, the game checks if the opponent is in:

   - **Check**: King is under attack but has legal moves
   - **Checkmate**: King is under attack and has no legal moves
   - **Stalemate**: King is not under attack but has no legal moves
   - **Playing**: Normal game state

2. **UI Integration**: The GameControls component displays:

   - Current game status with appropriate colors and icons
   - "Checkmate! [Winner] wins" message
   - "Stalemate - Draw" message
   - Game over message with reset instructions

3. **Move Prevention**: When the game is over (checkmate or stalemate):
   - No pieces can be selected or moved
   - Keyboard navigation is disabled
   - Only the reset button remains functional

## Testing Checkmate

Since checkmate is rare in normal gameplay, a debug feature has been added:

### Debug Feature (Development Mode Only)

1. Focus the game board (click on it)
2. Press the **'M'** key
3. This will set up a simple checkmate scenario for testing

The debug feature creates a position where:

- Black king is in the corner (a8)
- White queen on b7 delivers checkmate
- White king on b6 supports the queen

### Running Tests

The checkmate functionality is tested in:

- `src/__tests__/debug/checkmateDebugTest.test.js` - UI integration tests
- `src/__tests__/debug/realCheckmateTest.test.js` - Logic tests
- `src/__tests__/utils/checkmateScenarios.test.js` - Scenario tests

## Implementation Details

### Game Logic (`src/utils/gameLogic.js`)

- `isCheckmate()` - Detects checkmate conditions
- `isStalemate()` - Detects stalemate conditions
- `getGameStatus()` - Returns current game state
- `getAllLegalMovesForColor()` - Gets all legal moves for a player

### UI Components

- `GameBoard.js` - Prevents moves when game is over
- `GameControls.js` - Displays game status and end-game messages
- `Square.js` - Shows visual indicators for check

### Visual Indicators

- King in check: Red highlighting with warning icon
- Checkmate: Red status with checkered flag icon
- Stalemate: Purple status with handshake icon
- Game over: Prominent message with reset instructions

## Verification

The checkmate functionality has been verified to work correctly:

- ✅ Detects checkmate scenarios accurately
- ✅ Updates UI with appropriate messages
- ✅ Prevents further moves when game ends
- ✅ Maintains proper game state
- ✅ Allows reset to start new game
- ✅ Handles keyboard navigation properly
- ✅ Shows visual indicators for all game states
